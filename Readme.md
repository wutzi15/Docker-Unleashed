# Docker Unleashed
A (very early) Proposal for a free and distributed alternative to docker hub.

# What this is
**This is a proposal, a collection of ideas and an invitation for comments**

If you have any ideas please open a pull request.

# Why?
Starting on Nov. 1 2020 docker hub will limit the pulls for free repositories.  [More info here](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/).
As of today I cannot find any (good) alternatives for that. Please let me know, if I'm wrong.

# What?
This is a proposal for a free and open source alternative for a docker registry.

## Free
The system should be free to use.

## Open Source
The system should be an open source implemetation, with many contributors

## Distributed
The system should now rely on a single data center or server. It should be distributed across any contributing partners.

# How
- If you want to contribute disk space / bandwith the system should provide a way of registration and configuration.
- If you want to contribute money there should be a way to do so.
- If you want to contribute anything else there should be a community
